<h2 align="center">Software Architecture Guide</h2>

Here's the complete hierarchy for building robust applications:

### 1. Requirements Analysis \& Business Context

**Purpose**: Understanding what needs to be built<br>
**Focus**: Functional and non-functional requirements, business goals, user stories<br>
**Output**: Requirements specification, use cases, acceptance criteria<br>
**Stakeholders**: Business analysts, product managers, stakeholders<br>

### 2. Software Architecture (Highest Level)

**Purpose**: Defines the fundamental organizational structure of the software<br>
**Focus**: Architectural patterns, technology stack selection, foundational principles<br>
**Output**: Architectural blueprint, technology choices (e.g., microservices vs monolith)<br>
**Stakeholders**: Enterprise architects, principal engineers<br>
**Key Decisions**: Microservices, Event-Driven, Layered Architecture, Serverless<br>

### 3. System Design (Broad Implementation Planning)

**Purpose**: Translates architecture into a deployable system plan<br>
**Focus**: Infrastructure, scalability, reliability, performance, security<br>
**Output**: System architecture diagrams, infrastructure plans, deployment strategies<br>
**Stakeholders**: System architects, DevOps engineers, infrastructure architects<br>
**Key Components**: Load balancers, databases, caching layers, message queues, monitoring<br>

### 4. High-Level Design (HLD) - System Architecture Detail

**Purpose**: Defines the overall system structure and major components<br>
**Focus**: Component interactions, data flow, service boundaries, APIs<br>
**Output**: System diagrams, component specifications, interface definitions<br>
**Stakeholders**: Solution architects, tech leads, senior engineers<br>
**Key Elements**: Major modules, service interactions, data models, external integrations<br>

### 5. Low-Level Design (LLD) - Component Implementation Detail

**Purpose**: Detailed design of individual components and modules<br>
**Focus**: Class design, algorithms, data structures, method specifications<br>
**Output**: Class diagrams, sequence diagrams, detailed specifications, pseudocode<br>
**Stakeholders**: Senior developers, tech leads, development teams<br>
**Key Elements**: Object-oriented design, SOLID principles, interface definitions<br>

### 6. [Design Patterns (Implementation Solutions)](./Design_Patterns/Design_Pattern_1.md)

**Purpose**: Proven solutions to common design problems at the code level<br>
**Focus**: Reusable design templates, best practices, code organization<br>
**Output**: Pattern implementations, code templates, design guidelines<br>
**Application Level**: Applied within LLD for specific implementation challenges<br>
**Categories**: Creational, Structural, Behavioral patterns<br>

### The Flow in Practice

When building a robust application, the process flows systematically:

**Phase 1: Strategic Planning**

- **Requirements Analysis** → **Software Architecture**: Business needs drive architectural decisions

**Phase 2: System Planning**

- **Software Architecture** → **System Design**: Architectural patterns guide infrastructure choices

**Phase 3: Detailed Design**

- **System Design** → **HLD**: Infrastructure requirements shape component design
- **HLD** → **LLD**: Component specifications drive detailed implementation design

**Phase 4: Implementation**

- **LLD** → **Design Patterns**: Detailed designs use patterns for specific solutions


### Relationship and Dependencies

| Level | Depends On | Influences | Key Question |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Requirements** | Business needs | All design decisions | "What should the system do?" |
| **Software Architecture** | Requirements | System Design approach | "How should we structure the software?" |
| **System Design** | Software Architecture | Infrastructure and deployment | "How do we build and run this architecture?" |
| **HLD** | System Design | Component boundaries | "What are the major parts and how do they connect?" |
| **LLD** | HLD | Code structure | "How is each component implemented internally?" |
| **Design Patterns** | LLD challenges | Code quality and maintainability | "How do we solve this specific design problem?" |

### Prerequisites for Each Level

**For HLD**: Basic coding skills, understanding of databases, networking, microservices concepts, load balancing, message queues

**For LLD**: Object-oriented programming, design patterns, data structures and algorithms, SOLID principles

**For Design Patterns**: Strong OOP knowledge, understanding of common software problems, code refactoring experience

This hierarchical approach ensures that **each level provides the foundation** for the next, creating a systematic path from business requirements to maintainable code. Without proper execution at each level, the robustness of the final application is compromised.
